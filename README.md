The goal of this repo is to reproduce and extend http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01263 (An Online Gradient-Based Caching Policy with Logarithmic Complexity and Regret Guarantees).

I ended up with a modified version of the algorithm that probably is more efficient in time. The current version of the algorithm can be found in quantOGD.jl.
