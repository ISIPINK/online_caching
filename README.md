# Introduction

The goal of this repo was to reproduce and extend http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01263 (An Online Gradient-Based Caching Policy with Logarithmic Complexity and Regret Guarantees). We ended up with a quantized version of the algorithm.  

The notebook qOCD_explained.ipynb provides a brief explanation of the logic behind the quantized algorithm. 

The most advanced version of quantized caching descent can be found in the quantOGD_integral_mod_count.ipynb notebook.
